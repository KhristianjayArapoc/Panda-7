		<span data-tid=53916>FAQ About Auto Insurance</span>
		</h2><h5>Which insurers does Panda7 work with? </h5><p>Panda7 works with Canada’s top carriers, the most trusted insurers in the industry to offer you the most competitive rates from industry leaders. 
<br><br></p><h5>What do I need to start getting car insurance quotes with Panda7? </h5><p><ul>
  <li>A laptop, tablet or smartphone with internet connection</li>
  <li>A mobile phone number to receive an authentication code by Text / SMS</li>
  <li>3-10 minutes of spare time</li>
  <li>A valid driver’s license number and your vehicle registration (only required if you decide to purchase insurance online)</li>
  <li>A credit card to complete your purchase online</li>
</ul>
<br></p><h5>Can I use my nickname to get a quote with Panda7? </h5><p>To receive an accurate quote, you should provide your first and last name as written on your driver’s license or vehicle registration. 
<br><br></p><h5>What happens if I enter the wrong date of birth? </h5><p>Providing an accurate date of birth is required to receive a valid quote. All your information should be correct.
<br><br></p><h5>Where can I find my driver’s license number? </h5><p>Your driver’s license number can typically be located on your driver’s license or vehicle registration. In Quebec, a driver’s license number is composed of 13 characters, starting with the first letter of your last name.
<br><br></p><h5>Where can I find my VIN number? </h5><p>The Vehicle Identification Number or VIN is composed of 17 characters (digits and capital letters) that act as a unique identifier for your vehicle. You can find your VIN on the driver’s side dashboard in your car, specifically near where the dashboard meets the edge of the windshield. You can also find your VIN on your vehicle registration card. 
<br><br></p><h5>How long does it take to buy a car insurance policy with Panda7?</h5><p>A typical single-car, single-driver policy can be purchased in about 7 minutes – that’s 4 minutes to get multiple quotes and 3 minutes to complete the purchase. Panda7 presents important information about insurance products offered through its digital space on its website. We encourage you to take the time to carefully read this information and ask any questions you may have.
<br><br></p><h5>How many quotes can I get with Panda7? </h5><p>Panda7 can generate quotes for up to 7 insurers depending on the selected vehicle and your driver risk profile. Panda7 is working to add more insurers and offer more choices.
<br><br></p><h5>What is a “driver risk profile”? </h5><p>Risk profiles are what insurance companies use to calculate how much money they should charge on your insurance premium. Among other factors, insurers take your vehicle, location, mileage and driving history into account when factoring your price. This is why two people driving the same car will likely not pay the same price. 
<br><br></p><h5>What happens if my vehicle is not listed? </h5><p>Panda7 is designed to find the best insurance quotes for Quebec’s most popular vehicles.  If your car isn’t listed, simply contact us toll-free at <a style="font-weight:bold" href="tel: 1-877-777-6968"> 1-877-777-6968</a>. 
<br><br></p><h5>Why does it matter if my car is owned, leased of financed?   </h5><p>Insurers attribute the lowest risk profile to drivers of vehicles that are paid in full, then to financed vehicles, and lastly to leased vehicles. The highest risk profile is associated to vehicles financed with rates above 10% often referred to as a “second or third chance” financing.
<br><br></p><h5>Why is a TAG tracking device important?  </h5><p>Tag (<a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.tagtracking.ca/home">www.tagtracking.ca</a>) is the most effective stolen vehicle and anti-theft recovery system recognized by Quebec insurers. Thanks to hidden RFID wireless tags installed throughout your vehicle and its dedicated mobile tracking teams, Tag is capable of locating and recovering your vehicle in the event of theft.
<br><br></p><h5>How much do I save if I get a Tag system for my car? </h5><p>Depending on the insurer, installing a Tag system on your car can save you up to 25% on your insurance policy and will often covers the cost of the system within the first year. Some insurers may also require a Tag system as a condition for insurance. 
<br><br></p><h5>What does primary vehicle use mean? </h5><p>Insurers need to know your most frequent or “daily driving itineraries” in order to provide the most accurate rating.  Drivers who commute to work on a daily basis typically pay more than drivers who use their cars for grocery shopping and coffee runs. 
<br><br></p><h5>What happens if I can’t remember all claims or tickets in the past 6 years? </h5><p>Panda7 finds the best quotes based on your ticket and claim declaration. Once you purchase a policy, Panda7 will verify your declaration against official government records. Should a discrepancy occur, you will be notified with a price adjustment within the next business day. 
<br>
<br>
It is recommended to make sure no claims or tickets are missed. An incorrect declaration can lead to a fully declined policy in certain cases, or a price adjustment. 
<br>
<br>
Please note that parking tickets should not be declared.
<br><br></p><h5>Why does it matter at what age I got my license? </h5><p>Insurance companies associate a strong correlation between years of driving and safe driving. If you have more than 5 years of driving experience, this typically translates into savings on your auto insurance policy. 
<br><br></p><h5>Do I need to own the car to get a quote with Panda7? </h5><p>You are considered an owner if you purchased, financed or leased a car in your name. Only vehicle owners should purchase policies from Panda7. 
<br><br></p><h5>Can I add anyone as an additional driver? </h5><p>The additional driver can be anyone living at the same address. 
<br><br></p><h5>Can I use Panda7 to add any driver to my existing policy? </h5><p>If you already have an active auto insurance policy purchased through Panda7, you may contact us any time to add a driver or make any other important updates to your policy. To ensure adequate coverage at all times, you should report any significant updates which may affect your policy. 
<br><br></p><h5>Can I use Panda7 to get additional coverage on my existing policy? </h5><p>If you already have an active auto insurance policy purchased through Panda7, you may contact us any time to add extra coverage or make any other important updates to your policy. To ensure adequate coverage at all times, you should report any significant updates which may affect your policy. 
<br><br></p><h5>Can I use Panda7 to get insurance on someone else’s car? </h5><p>No. You are considered an owner if you purchased, financed or leased a car in your name. Only vehicle owners should purchase policies from Panda7. 
<br><br></p><h5>I bought a policy and realized I made a mistake in one of the steps. What should I do? </h5><p>Contact us asap! We are reachable by <a style="font-weight:bold" href="tel: 1-877-777-6968">phone</a> or <a style="font-weight:bold" href="mailto:info@panda7.ca">email</a> from Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm EST. 
<br><br></p><h5>Why are the insurer prices I’m seeing higher than my current policy? </h5><p>Car insurance premiums can fluctuate often. Panda7 does not control the prices returned back across the insurers and only searches across the carriers for the best prices at the time of your search. 
<br>
<br>

<br><br></p><h5>Why do I keep seeing “contact us for more details?” </h5><p>Some insurance companies require more information to confirm rates. Some of the reasons may include:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Information entered is wrong, insufficient or missing</li>
  <li>Bad credit score</li>
  <li>Too many claims</li>
  <li>Complex driving history</li>
</ul>
<br></p><h5>Can I get a bundle discount for insuring two cars with different insurers? </h5><p>No. Most insurers will typically offer bundle discounts for putting two or more vehicles on the same policy. If you’ve quoted a policy for two or more cars but need difference coverage start dates for each car, please contact us toll free at <a style="font-weight:bold" href="tel: 1-877-777-6968"> 1-877-777-6968</a> or by email at <a style="font-weight:bold" href="mailto:info@panda7.ca">info@panda7.ca</a>.
<br><br></p><h5>Am I able to get quotes on Panda7 if I don’t have a driver’s license? </h5><p>Auto insurance quotes can be generated without submitting a driver’s licence number. A valid driver’s license number will however be required to purchase a policy. 
<br><br></p><h5>What happens if I’ve been cancelled by an insurer in the last 3 years? </h5><p>As a precaution, some insurers might simply want to take a closer look at your file before granting a final approval. However, it’s important to note that submitting a false declaration can lead to having a future claim denied. 
<br><br></p><h5>What happens if I’ve had my driver’s license suspended in the past 3 years? </h5><p>As a precaution, some insurers might simply want to take a closer look at your file before granting a final approval. However, it’s important to note that submitting a false declaration can lead to having a future claim denied. 
<br><br></p><h5>Which address should I use? </h5><p>You should use the same address printed on your driver’s license. If you have moved since, use the address listed on the back of your driver’s license card or your temporary driver’s license paper. If you have not advised the SAAQ of a recent address change, visit <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/reach-us/change-address/individual/">SAAQ's address changing service</a>
<br><br></p><h5>Why do I need to enter a VIN to purchase a car insurance policy? </h5><p>A VIN is a unique identifier for your car. Entering your VIN will confirm that the vehicle make, year and model you selected is correct. 
<br><br></p><h5>Can I enter any phone number?  </h5><p>A valid mobile phone number is required to authenticate you as “not a robot” and send you an access code required to view your quotes. 
<br><br></p><h5>How long are my quotes valid for? </h5><p>Once you’ve obtained your Panda7 quotes, our prices are guaranteed for 15 days so you can shop confidently, but deep down, we know you’ll be back sooner. 
<br><br></p><h5>Why do I see multiple quotes from the same insurer?  </h5><p>Some insurers offer different programs which may warrant different pricing. For example, Intact Insurance may offer a policy that requires the use of a mobile app to monitor driver behavior as alongside a standard policy that does not require the use of the app. In general, app-based policies will typically be more competitive. 
<br><br></p><h5>Why is the price gap so wide between insurers?  </h5><p>Car insurance premiums can vary significantly between insurance companies due to the rating factors they use, the statistical information they look at, their historical claim data and the cost of doing business. 
<br><br></p><h5>Why should I choose any quote other than the cheapest?  </h5><p>Since all Panda7 insurers partners offer outstanding consumer satisfaction rating and claims experience, we always recommend choosing the lowest quote so you can put your hard-earned dollars towards something you like. Consider it dinner on us! 
<br><br></p><h5>How long are Panda7 policies valid for?  </h5><p>All Panda7 insurance policies are valid for 12 months as of the designated start date. 
<br><br></p><h5>My current car insurance policy doesn’t expire for until a few months from now. How soon can I start shopping on Panda7?  </h5><p>Why not start today? Panda7 lets you shop for insurance any time. Should you decide to purchase a new policy before your current policy’s expiry to “lock in” your rate, you can activate your new policy within 90 days of the date of purchase. Just ensure you have no insurance gap between your old and new policy. 
<br><br></p><h5>I have an active car insurance policy which is not yet expired. Can I choose my Panda7 policy start date?  </h5><p>Absolutely! Panda7 lets you buy a new insurance policy any time and activate it within 90 days. Your billing cycle will only start on the date of activation. Just ensure you have no insurance gap between your old and new policy. 
<br><br></p><h5>What does ‘certain exclusions apply’ mean?  </h5><p>Much like any standard contract, insurance contracts also list exclusions that are predetermined by the Insurance Bureau of Canada. For more information on standard exclusions, visit IBC's <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.ibc.ca/qc/insurance-101/know-your-policy">Know Your Policy</a> page.
<br><br></p><h5>Can I get a quote if I live outside of Québec?</h5><p>At this time, Panda7 services customers residing in “la belle province” only. Policies sold through Panda7 do however cover customers who drive outside the province. 
<br><br></p><h5>What does third party liability limit mean and how much do I need?  </h5><p>In the province of Quebec, third party liability is a mandatory coverage which protects you against “no-fault” collision damages (in Quebec only), “at-fault” property damage and bodily injury for an accident outside Quebec and “at-fault” material damages caused to a third party. While Panda7 offers a $1,000,000 or $2,000,000 liability limit option, we strongly recommend $2,000,000 for drivers who travel outside of the province. 
<br><br></p><h5>What does collision deductible mean and how much do I need?  </h5><p>This section covers damages to your vehicle caused by a collision if you are at fault. The insurance company will apply the selected $500 or $1,000 deductible. 
<br><br></p><h5>What does comprehensive deductible mean and how much do I need?  </h5><p>This specifically covers your vehicle in the event of theft, fire, vandalism, wind, hail, water damage as well as damage to your windshield. The insurance company will apply the selected ($250, $500 or $1,000) deductible when there’s a claim. 
<br><br></p><h5>Can Panda7 notify me when rates for my car get interesting? </h5><p>Yes, you can always send us your target price and we will notify once a company can match it.
<br><br></p><h5>How can I reduce my auto insurance premium? </h5><p>Aside from shopping your policy as much as humanly possible, the best ways to save on your auto insurance premium are to:  
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a vehicle with low repair costs </li>
  <li>Up your deductibles</li>
  <li>Bundle your auto and home insurance from the same insurer</li>
  <li>Consider adding an anti-theft device like Tag that can save you up to 25%</li>
  <li>Drive carefully!</li>

		<span data-tid=53917>FAQ About Tenant Insurance</span>
		</h2><h5>What types of properties does tenant insurance cover? </h5><p>Tenant insurance covers any type of property that you can rent as your main residence such as a single dwelling home, apartment or condo.

<br><br></p><h5>Does my name need to be on the lease to buy tenant insurance? </h5><p>No. Since, tenant insurance covers the declared replacement value of your personal belongings against fire and theft and not the property itself, it’s not required to provide any lease details.

		<span data-tid=53918>FAQ About Condo Insurance</span>
		</h2><h5>What is condo insurance?</h5><p>Condo insurance is insurance you purchase that offers coverage to mend the gaps and exposures that the condominium association master policy may leave. While it depends on the amount of coverage you purchase and what the master policy already protects, your average condo policy may include coverage for your utilities and appliances, the interior walls of your individual unit, and your personal property. In addition to this, your condo insurance also protects your personal liability, in the event you are responsible for someone else’s injury or property damage. </p><h5>Why is it important?</h5><p>Condo insurance is important because many condo owners assume their condo association’s master policy will cover them. This is true to some extent, but it leaves out some features of your personal unit, your amenities and possessions, and your personal liability. Without condo insurance, you may be left to pay for these items solo.</p><h5>What does condo insurance cover?</h5><p>Your condominium association has a master policy that may cover every original appliance, system (wiring, plumbing) and original furniture in your personal unit as well as common areas, or the “bare minimum” which does not include anything within your walls but covers common areas and the condo association’s liability. You may choose to review your condo’s master policy to ensure that the condo insurance you purchase will cover anything that this policy does not. <br/>
That should include: <br/>
•	Your personal unit, if your condo’s master policy omits this<br/>
•	Your valuables and possessions<br/>
•	Your personal liability<br/>
Basically, you will want your condo insurance to cover the gaps left by the condo association master policy. You can enlist the help of a broker to ensure this is done properly.
</p><h5>Does it include my valuables?</h5><p>Your condo insurance will include coverage for your personal belongings up until a stated limit. It doesn’t hurt to take an inventory of everything you own to assess if your coverage is enough.
You can purchase a rider or insurance “floater” (as it’s sometimes referred to in the insurance sphere) to include your valuable possessions or expensive collectibles if your existing coverage is not enough to cover them. You may want to request the help of your insurance broker to review your needs and help you choose the most suitable plan for your requirements.
</p><h5>What does the “condo association master policy” cover?</h5><p>Your condo association master policy can be one of two types: it can cover the appliances and fixtures in your condo, carpeting or flooring, plumbing, but exclude your personal property. This is sometimes referred to as an “all-inclusive” master policy. Or, your condo association master policy can be a “bare walls” master policy, which means it will not cover anything within your walls. This can sometimes include your condo’s systems, but sometimes it won’t. No matter which type your condo association master policy falls under, it will include coverage to common areas and the condo association’s liability.</p><h5>Does my condo insurance cover my appliances and utilities?</h5><p>Yes, your appliances are covered with replacement cost up to the limit of your insurance amount.</p><h5>Does my condo insurance cover theft or vandalism?</h5><p>Vandalism, burglary and theft are included in your condo insurance if you have personal property coverage. This can even extend to items stolen from your vehicle, just as home insurance might cover personal belongings in your car. There are always exclusions, especially with higher value items. You may need to inquire about a rider or endorsement for full coverage if you own any valuables.
Always take a full inventory of everything you own so that you know how much coverage you need and what their total value is. You can adjust accordingly. Condo owners are often surprised to see the total value of everything they own!
</p><h5>Does my condo insurance cover natural disasters?</h5><p>Major storms like windstorms and tornadoes are covered for your possessions and the interior of your condo, if your condo association master policy does not already included coverage for this. Your condo association master policy may also cover damages to plumbing, wiring, fixtures, etc. – but you should check to see beforehand and ensure that your condo insurance policy covers any gaps. </p><h5>How much condo insurance do I need?</h5><p>Everyone needs a different amount of condo insurance based on the valuables they own and what their condo association master policy does/does not include. You may want to take inventory of all your belongings and calculate the total cost it would take to replace your belongings as they stand today following a disaster. Some valuables may even require additional coverage.
A broker will be able to help navigate your needs and discuss your coverage requirements with you. They can help you find the right policy that covers the gaps your condo association master policy leaves and protects your personal assets, investments, and your personal liability.
</p><h5>How much does condo insurance cost?</h5><p>The cost of condo insurance varies by location, condominium, value of personal property, and the coverage you carry. You can get a quote from an insurance broker (like Panda7) to estimate how much your condo insurance will cost overall. Typically, a condo insurance policy can cost as little as $20 per month, ranging between the averages of $25 to $35 per month. You can expect to pay more or less depending on your limits and coverage options.</p></section></div><div class="tab-pane fade " id="discounts"><section class="py-5">
